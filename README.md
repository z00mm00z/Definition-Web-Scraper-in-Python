# Definition Web Scraper in Python
 A Python script that scrapes word definitions off of the internet using the BeautifulSoup module. Uses CSV files as input. Definitions are scraped from Google, Dictionary.com and Merriam Webster. Attempts to scrape in that order. Data is only saved once all definitions have been found.
